          I grew up on the islands of Hawai'i, but was lured away by school, and ended up falling in love with the Bay Area.
          When I was young, I visited Taiwan every year and was fortunate enough to travel to other places of the world with my family.
          Now I definitely think I have developed a wanderlust, and want to share my experiences with others in case it helps with your travels.
