So... there is a reason that there are so many tourists in Kyoto.  It was once the capital of Japan, and a center of culture, dance, and entertainment.  Today, many of the culturally-rich pockets remain, and people love to visit the various beautiful temples and gardens.  Stories such as memoirs of a geisha, although not actually representative of reality, have also made this city famous, with wonderful shots of Fushimi-Inari Taisha, Heian Jingu, and Gion.  We visited many places during the visit, but since it was my 3rd time and Vince's 2nd time to the city, we focused more on cherry blossoms and less on visiting various temples and castles.  I'll just highlight some of the places we visited, but feel free to ask me questions about other tourist spots.

### Sakura

There are quite a few places to view sakura, and they bloom at varying times, so depending on whether you're there closer to first bloom, or closer to mankai, it may be good to target different places. 

Earlier bloomers:  There are plentiful cherry blossom trees that line the Kamo River.  The trees that bloom the earliest are south of Gojo-dori.  I ran 13 miles along the river, and Vince ran 18 miles, so we confirmed that the trees along the south end of the river definitely bloom earlier.  Further up, north of Imadegawa-dori, there are huge cherry blossom trees which are perfect for picnicking under, but they bloom a little later in the season (a few days to a week later).  There is also a massive weeping cherry tree in the middle of Maruyama Park that blooms beautifully, fairly early.

Middle bloomers:   Trees line the Path of Philosophy and Kiyamachi-dori leading to Gion, and it's pretty to walk on these streets as well, with sakura petals lightly falling around you.  The Pathy of Philosophy received its name because a famous philosopher, Nishida Kitaro, is thought to have practiced daily meditation while walking along this path to get to Kyoto University.  Kyoto Botanical Gardens and the gardens of the Imperial Palace also have many cherry blossom trees that bloom at various times.

Late bloomers:  The cherry blossom trees at Heian Jingu and Kinkakuji bloom quite late, so we missed these when we went.  Heian Jingu has one of my favorite gardens, and it's peaceful to walk through when there aren't too many tourists.  We expected to see a lot of people there during cherry blossom season, but it wasn't too crowded, even though we went at 10am.  We went to Kinkakuji at 9am when they opened, thinking this would be a good time to go, but I would actually recommend against it.  Long lines form right before they open, and it leads to a huge bottleneck that arrives to the best viewing spots immediately.  After 30 minutes or so, this bottleneck clears, and it becomes easier to have an unobstructed view of the famous Golden Pavilion.

### Arashiyama

I used to recommend Arashiyama as a quick side trip to anyone visiting Kyoto, but after this trip, I don't know that I would recommend it to anyone.  What used to be a pleasant stroll in the bamboo forest near Tenryu-ji has become a walk quite similar to cattle being herded.  Although it does get more crowded during the day, many people also head there first thing in the morning, so once the sun is up, expect to see a good number of people there.  Similarly for the Monkey Park Iwatayama, it is much more crowded than before, but is a bit more bearable than the bamboo forest, as some tourists are dissuaded by the 20-40 min (depending on how fit you are) hike to the top of the mountain.  Keep in mind that there is also a 550 JPY fee to get into the park.  Once you near the top of the mountain, you start seeing the Japanese Macaques running around.  There is a slide near the top, and if you're lucky, you may see some of the macaques sliding or chasing each other down this slide.  Be careful not to stare them in the eye, as they can take this as a sign of aggression, and try to attack.  At the top of the mountain, you can purchase some food from the park rangers, and feed them from inside a fenced shed.  Meaning you are fenced in, and they are free!

Since Arashiyama is well-known for soy/tofu, another fun thing to try is yuba softserve, which is the top layer of soy milk when it's boiled.  I love the soy flavor, but the first time I went to Arashiyama, the lady selling it to me showed me that you can hold the cone upside down and shake it, and the soft serve won't fall out!  This is because yuba is very sticky, although you don't taste the difference when eating it.  We found it at a random shop near the Arashiyama station, but there is also a well-known shop called Kyozuan in Kyoto.

### Fushimi-Inari Taisha

I had been wanting to visit this Shinto shrine for a long time, and finally made it there on this trip.  You can see the many vermilion torii of this shrine in Memoirs of a Geisha, and the amount of work that went into building these torii is amazing.  As indicated by its name, this shrine is dedicated to the Shinto god of rice.  You'll see many fox flanking the shrines, which are thought to be Inari's messengers.  We arrived at the shrine around 7am, and there were some people already heading out, which means they likely arrived at 6am or earlier.  There were already several tourists starting the trek up through the torii when we arrived, but the crowd thins out the further you go up.  There are some restaurants along the way, which were all closed at the hour we went.  They sell dishes within the theme of the shrine, such as inari sushi, kitsune (fox) udon, and aburaage, a favorite food of foxes.  After about 30 minutes, you reach the Yotsutsuji intersection, where the path divides into a few different options.  Many hikers will stop at this viewpoint, but you can continue to hike up further if you want to pray at the top or enjoy the torii with less tourists.  The hike to the summit and back down took us roughly 2 hours, and we mainly took our time.  It actually started to snow (in April!) when we were coming back down through the Yotsutsuji intersection.

### Food

Food in Kyoto would probably require a blog post all on its own, but I'll just mention a couple of places here, since it wasn't the focus of our Kyoto visit this time.

- Gion Kotora - We came here upon the recommendation of Vince's coworker, since his family member owns the restaurant.  It turned out be a delicious teppanyaki restaurant, with food cooked and grilled to perfection.  I highly recommend coming here, but would make a reservation if possible, as it's a pretty cozy restaurant.

- Hinode - I had originally bookmarked Yamamoto Menzo and Gontaro Shijo as places to try udon in Kyoto, but the former required a reservation, and the latter was closed on Wednesdays.  Thus, we found Hinode instead, which had a line out the door - usually a pretty good indicator that it's good, especially if there are mostly Japanese people in the line rather than tourists.  Hinode did not disappoint, and they specialize in curry udon, but also had a small selection of other types of udon as well.  We opted for a lighter egg-based udon, which was still really good.
