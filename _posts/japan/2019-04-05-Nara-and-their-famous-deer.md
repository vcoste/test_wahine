I'm sure most people have heard of the famous bowing deer in Nara.  The first time I visited Nara was during Golden Week, and the deer were so full from being fed by the tourists that they had no interest in the deer biscuits and bowing.  This time we were lucky, and the deer were much more interactive.

### Todaiji

Aside from Nara Park to see the deer and cherry blossoms, our only other stop in Nara was Todaiji.  The main hall, or Daibutsuden, contains one of Japan's largest bronze statues of Buddha.  There is a pillar in this hall which has a hole in its base, that is the size of one of the Big Buddha's nostril.   Legend has it that those who can squeeze through this hole will reach enlightenment in their next life.  There is always a long line of people hoping to crawl through the hole, mostly consisting of children.  Adults can fit as well, but when I squeezed through over 10 years ago, it was small enough that I had no leverage to pull myself through, so I lay there in limbo until someone gave me a little pull, haha.  In the picture below, a skinny elderly man is facing the same issue!
