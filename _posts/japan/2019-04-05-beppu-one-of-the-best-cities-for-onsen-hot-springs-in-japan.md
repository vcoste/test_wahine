We decided to visit Beppu because it's my friend, Ayako's, hometown, and I was actually hoping she would be there when we visited.  However, she was stuck in Kamakura when we visited, so we wandered around on our own.  


Beppu is nestled between volcanic mountains and Beppu Bay, which gives it the unique setting of having onsen near the beach.  Unfortunately, we only had two partial days here, since we also wanted to spend a couple of days relaxing in Yufuin.


Onsen

Kitahama Terumasu - This is a somewhat non-traditional onsen in that the hot spring feeds into a large pool, which is coed, meaning you need to wear a swimsuit.  If you've ever visited the hot springs in Banff, it's very similar to that, but much less crowded.  The pool has a couple of smaller pools adjoining it, and it overlooks the beach.  Keep in mind that if you don't bring a towel, you'll need to rent or buy one.  https://www.city.beppu.oita.jp/seikatu/gaikokujinmuke/ei/detail11.html 

Shoningan Seaside Bath - The idea of a sand bath looking out to the ocean sounds really nice.  However, the waits here are insane.  We arrived a little before 11am, and were told that the next available time was 1pm, but that we would have to come back and check in with them a little after noon.  I asked if we could reserve a later time, at 2pm, but I think she said there were a lot of people waiting ahead of us, so that wasn't possible.  Which didn't really make sense, so maybe the language barrier got in the way!  She didn't speak any English.  Checking back in with them a little after noon meant that we really didn't have enough time to leave, eat lunch, and come back, so we decided to wait there.  However, there isn't much to do in the area, and the wind was bitingly cold.  They have a foot bath nearby, but the water was so hot that no one could keep their feet in longer than a few seconds at a time.  When we checked in again at the specified time, the lady gave us a funny look, and told us we had 3 groups ahead of us.  We didn't end up getting in until 1:30pm, and though being buried in sand is surprisingly relaxing, it was definitely not worth the wait.  I wouldn't recommend going here unless you go when they first open, or have a lot of time to spare.

Jigoku (Hell) Onsen - There are 7 jigoku onsen in total, and they all have different characteristics.  Keep in mind that these onsen are attractions rather than hot spring that you can bathe in.  We did not know this!  We went to Kamado Jigoku, thinking we would find a pleasant rotemburo (open-air bath) to bathe in.  Instead, we paid 400 yen to enter what literally felt like a chaotic zoo.  There were huge Korean tour groups, overflowing the seating areas and foot baths.  The tour guides were yelling loudly over microphones, and it honestly sounded like a rally in there.  Other tour guides were tooting on loud whistles or what sounded like swim meet horns, and there was a constant stream of people surrounding the beautiful blue Kamado jigoku.  If it hadn't been so crowded, it's definitely an interesting place to visit as it has several mud baths, some onsen water you can drink, a steam bath for your throat and face, an area with hot stones on which you can warm your feet, and the large blue, really pretty pond to view.  There's also an area with foot baths, and where they sell special Onsen Piitan, or onsen egg that is particular to this jigoku, as it is steam cooked for about 24 hours.  We were so turned off by the hordes of people, that we passed through all of these areas quickly.  

Food


Fortunately, Ayako had given us some restaurant recommendations, so we ate a couple of really good meals while we were there.  We did, however, get sucked into another tourist trap as well.


Toyotsune - If you like tempura, you definitely need to come here.  Ten-don (tempura over rice) in the U.S. is usually a far cry from ten-don in Japan, from the crispy, fresh tempura, to the plump Japanese rice, to the light, shoyu-based dressing.  At Toyotsune, you can order 2, 3, or 4 shrimp tempura depending on how hungry you are.  They also have other items on the menu, including toriten (chicken tempura), a specialty of Oita.

Rokusei - This restaurant is famous for reimen, which is cold noodles.  However, Ayako recommended their chuuka-soba, which is soba in a soy-based broth.  Rokusei is located in a neighborhood with very few restaurants, so it's easy to miss unless you know it's there.  We only saw Japanese people eating in there. 


Jigoku Mushi Kobo - This is becoming a bit of a trend for my review of Beppu, but this place was very disappointing for us, due to the crowd, long wait, and exorbitant prices.  The idea is that you buy ingredients for varying dishes using their vending machines, and pay cooking fees to use their hot spring steamers, which vary in price depending on the size of the dishes you purchase.  It sounded really fun, but we came here after waiting a miserably long time at the Shoningan Seaside Baths, only to find out that we had to wait at least another hour to eat here.  The prices were quite ridiculous... I wish I had taken a picture of them, but a plate of simple vegetables was something around 1500 yen, while small portions of meat or seafood ranged from 2000-3500 yen.  I had researched this place before our trip, and various websites mentioned that the food here was reasonably priced, so maybe things have changed since those reviews.  The alternative is to purchase ingredients elsewhere and bring it in to cook, but they even charge an "outside food" fee on top of the cooking fee.  We ended up sharing a small plate of pork and veggies, which in the end, just tasted like... well, steamed pork.  If you do decided to eat here for the experience, there is a free foot bath right next door that you can use while waiting.

          There is another steam restaurant called Satonoeki Kannawa, which reviews mention

          is a bit nicer, but even more expensive.  If that's the case, it's also likely not worth a 

          visit.  If you want to try some steamed food but don't want to go to a restaurant, there 

          is a small shop (鉄輪豚まん本舗) where you can buy some Kannawa butaman, or 

          steamed pork buns. You can find it by walking down Ideyu-zaka street and turning left 

          after Yokoso Inn, and it'll be on the right a little ways down.  Also, if you walk west on 

          Ideyu-zaka away from Jigoku Mushi, right past Shiraike Jigoku, they sell steamed 

          eggs, corn, and sweet potato.


Sightseeing


We didn't do a whole lot of sightseeing in Beppu, since it's a bit hard to get around without a car.  We just visited Beppu Park in hopes of seeing cherry blossom trees.  It's a small park, but filled with nice areas such as a bamboo forest, small lake, a tulip garden, and plentiful cherry blossom trees. It's a great place to sit by the lake, or under the trees, and have a picnic.
