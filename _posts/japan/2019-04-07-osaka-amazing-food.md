Osaka is well known for their food, and their specialties include takoyaki, okonomiyaki, negiyaki, yakiniku, kushikatsu, and many more.  We only had 1.5 days to spend here, so we didn't get to explore too much, but I'll include some lists of restaurants well known for their okonomiyaki and takoyaki.

## Okonomiyaki

* Okaru
* Houzneji Sanpei
* Fukutaro
* Mizuno
* Kiji Sky
* Okonomiyaki Chitose
* Ajinoya
* Yukari
* Hana
* Jibundoki

We ended up eating at Yukari Sennichimae, because we were in the area, and enjoyed the meal, as they served standard, tasty Osaka-style okonomiyaki.  Osaka-style okonomiyaki is different from Hiroshima-style in that they mix all the ingredients together (egg, shredded cabbage, flour) rather than layering them one at a time, and they don't contain noodles.  We had our own grill at our table, which is also standard for Osaka-style okonomiyaki.

## Takoyaki

* Kukuru
* Wanaka
* Hanadako
* Otako
* Takoyaki Yamachan
* Kogaryu
* Aiduya
* Yama-chan
* Juhachi-ban
* Kouga-Ryu

We had takoyaki at Hanadako, which is located in Umeda Eki and pretty difficult to find in the labyrinth of restaurants in the station. They are famous for their negi-mayo takoyaki, or green onion with Japanese mayonnaise.  The picture below shows what high quality takoyaki should look like, with the crispy outside, and the gooey, hot inside containing the tako, or octopus.

## Yakiniku

Our good friend, Tomoyuki, highly recommended Yakiniku Champion, but alas, we couldn't get in without a reservation.  Thus, we searched at random, and found a gem of a tiny mom and pop shop, which we loved largely for the super friendly owners.  It's called Doushintei (同心亭), and is located near O River in Temma.  The owners don't speak any English, and despite the fact that I speak very little Japanese, the cute ojiisan chef was not deterred, and rambled away at us in Japanese, giving us advice about things to do and see in Osaka.  We accepted all of his recommendations for types of meat, mainly because we didn't understand what he was saying, and it was all delicious.

In Temma, we also went to Rikyu Pudding and tried their hojicha and premium pudding, which uses Oita eggs. It was so good!


## Umeda Sky Building

My family friend is into architecture, and recommended the Umeda Sky Building, which has Floating Garden Observatory 170 m high.  The architecture of the building is definitely unique, and it's the nineteenth tallest building in Osaka, offering great views of the city.

## Route 271

This is actually a bakery that we just walked by, which caught our attention because of the long line outside.  We figured again, Must be good!  And stood in line to wait as well.  And it paid off once again... the pastries here look simple, but are taste, fresh, and baked to perfection.  This is another high recommendation.

## Ichiran

Yes yes, Ichiran (which serves ramen) is definitely not unique to Osaka, or even to Japan, now that one has opened in New York, and most people have probably heard of it.  But in case you haven't tried it, it is definitely worth checking out. The concept of the restaurant is based on efficient, solo-eating, allowing you to really savor your ramen with minimal distractions.  The seats are sectioned off into cubicles, and the serving staff hidden from sight by a sliding window.  You fill out an order form, specifying your broth, flavor strength, noodle texture, level of spicyness, and additional noodles or toppings.  When they open the window to take your order form and serve your food, you only see their hands, and there is no need for eye contact or communication.  The restaurant originated in Hakata, and they serve Hakata's specialty, which is tonkotsu ramen, where the broth is extracted from 100% pork bones.  We didn't realize that we could open up our partition until we were nearly finished with our meal!
