Yufuin is a hot spring resort that is more remote than Beppu, about an hour train ride away.  We wanted to stay in a peaceful ryokan where we could just relax, and enjoy quiet, leisurely days.  Yufuin was perfect for this.  We were trying to decide between a ryokan in Yufuin City, or one that was more out of the way, but that utilized the famous Yunohira hot spring water.  We ended up opting for Yamashiroya, located in Yunohira, and we're really glad we did.

### Yamashiroya
 This ryokan deserves its own section for sure.  I'll break it down into a few sections:

**1. Hospitality** - The staff at this ryokan really go above and beyond.  On their website, they encourage you to contact them before your stay, so they can arrange to pick you up from the JR Yunohira Station.  This is probably my only negative experience with them, because I e-mailed them twice and never received a response.  You can call them too, but I was too lazy to do so.  They mention that if someone doesn't pick you up, they will reimburse your taxi fair.  We arrived at the station around 6pm, and two other groups of people exited the train at the same time as us.  When we got to the front of the station, we saw a man get out of a van, calling out that he was from Yamashiroya.  I got his attention and told him that we were going to the same place, but the van was full.  Thus, he spoke to the nearby tax driver for us, and paid the driver once we arrived at the inn, so we didn't have to worry about anything.  The hostess of the inn greeted us at the door, and she spoke English quite well.  She helped us pick out our yukata, then gave us a thorough explanation of their TV guide in the room.  Their TV guide is very thorough, with selections that show you how to put on your yukata, how to catch a train at the train station (more complicated than usual at JR Yunohira!), and even how to appropriately use the toilet paper.  There is even a selection that lets you know, in real time, if their onsen/rotemburo are available or in use.

**2. Onsen** - This ryokan has 4 baths in total, two indoor onsen and two rotemburo (open-air bath).  They are first-come first-serve, and as mentioned above, you can check if they're occupied via the TV in each guest room.  Once you enter the bath, you just lock the door and voila!  Private onsen.

**3. Food** - This is definitely a highlight of this ryokan.  The price per night includes breakfast and dinner, and they are traditional ryokan meals, with numerous small dishes that are well put-together, with fresh, seasonal ingredients.  Rather than having our meals set up in our room, as is the case with some ryokan, they have a dining room where they bring everyone's dishes.  The first night we were in this communal dining room, but since we stayed here 2 nights, the second night we were seated in a private dining room.  The food is plentiful, and we even heard a couple of parties turning down the rest of their dishes, because they were too full.  The first night, some of the larger dishes included yakiniku, sashimi, tempura, and fish, finished off with an amazing yuzu and pear sorbet. The second night included nigiri, hamachi kama, and this really delicious deep fried mochi.  Dessert included an amaou strawberry (premium strawberry from Fukuoka), amoaou strawberry ice cream, and a clear mochi filled with custard.  The quality of the food was top notch, and was one of the reasons why we chose this ryokan.

### Yufuin City
On our second day, we took a train into Yufuin, and walked around to explore.  It's probably worthwhile to note that this train line runs very infrequently, so it's good to check the schedule ahead of time.  When we were ready to head out, and we had just missed a train, and needed to wait 1.5 hours for the next train.  Thus, once we got to the city, we were really hungry.  You can check the train schedule on Google Maps, or the ryokan also has a printed schedule they can show you  The visitor's center near the station recommended a walking route for us, and we were able to see Mt Yufu, Kirin Lake, and Yufuin Floral Village along the way.

Yufuin Village is a good spot for kids, but can be fun for adults too.  It has a cute, old English atmosphere, and apparently some scenes from Harry Potter were filmed here.  The village consists of cute little houses adorned with flowers and lamps.  These little houses have been converted into character-themed shops.  For example, there is a Totoro shop, Kiki's Delivery Service, Snow White, etc.  No one actually mans the shops, but you pick up any items you want to buy, and take it to a cash register further down the walkway.  There is also a market and some restaurants, including The Cotswold Dining.

There are a couple of streets in Yufuin Street that are lined with cafes, shops, and small restaurants.  We strolled along these streets, and ate some menchi katsu, freshly roasted chestnuts, and soft serve.  At the end of the afternoon, we stopped by the Mame Shiba Inu Cafe, which I realized after is a chain, that is linked to the bengal cat an owl forests.  I would probably recommend against going to this chain, and to support local animal cafes instead.  I can only speak to the shiba inu cafe, but it seems like the shiba inu are well treated here, and they have a lot of rules to make sure that customers treat the dogs appropriately.  However, there is a strict 30 minute time limit, and you only get a drink from a vending machine, so it's not a real cafe.  Going in, I knew that shiba inu are fairly aloof and tend to be wary of strangers, so there wouldn't necessarily be a lot of interactions with the dogs.  However, 30 minutes really isn't enough time for them to warm up to you at all, so we probably could have spent our time/money better elsewhere.

### Taking the Train
There is actually a video on how to do this in Yamashiroya's TV program, and there are also signs in both English and Japanese at the train station itself.  Despite all of this, we still took the train "wrong," so I'll describe it briefly here!  As I mentioned before, the JR Yunohira is a small train station.  Since no one mans the train station, rather than buying a ticket a head of time, you take a ticket when boarding the train, and pay at your destination.  Since it's such a small station, the train conductor only opens the doors of the first car (out of two cars).  You board the train via the rear door and take a ticket from the machine, whereas you disembark the train via the front door.  We accidentally boarded the train via the front door, thinking we needed to board near the conductor, but the machine at the front doesn't automatically dispense a ticket.  After some fumbling with the machine, the conductor took pity on us and forced a dispense for us, amidst snickers and funny looks from the other passengers.  Not a real issue, but hopefully you can avoid some confusion this way.
