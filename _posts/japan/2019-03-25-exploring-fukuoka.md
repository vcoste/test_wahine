Unlike some of the more frequented cities in Japan, such as Tokyo, Kyoto, Hiroshima, and Hakone, Fukuoka is not very touristy.  Of course, there are still several tourist sites you can visit, but my favorite thing about Fukuoka is its character and its specialty cuisines.  Even though it was sakura season, we didn't see the same throngs of tourists here that we saw in Kyoto and Miyajima.  Fortunately for us, even though Fukuoka is a convenient city to visit from nearby Asian countries, it is still relatively undiscovered by the Western countries. 


This means it's a bit easier to go with the flow, and explore spontaneously what this trendy, artsy city has to offer.  It also means that my boyfriend, now fiance, was able to find a quiet area in a cherry blossom grove to propose to me!  


### Shopping

For those who love shopping, Fukuoka is a great city for this.  Different neighborhoods offer different styles of clothing, and it took us a bit of time of wandering before we figured out where our styles were located.

* Daimyo - This very trendy area has plentiful boutiques, restaurants, cafes, and bars.  Vince found the men's clothing here too "American rapster" for his liking, but there is a bit more variety for women's clothing.  I found a couple of boutiques with the trendy, somewhat girly style that I like.  While shopping, we went to Manu Coffee, a popular hipster cafe chain in Fukuoka that uses locally roasted beans.  The cafe located in Daimyo, and the one located near Yanagibashirengo Market, are both super cute in their own ways.

* Tenjin - Right next to Daimyo, and home to abundant nightlife, Tenjin also has numerous shops, from big-name brands to local Japanese stores.  You can visit large departments stores, and Tenjin Chikagai, an underground area with small shops and restaurants, which is pretty characteristic near many of Japan's large subway stations.  In Tenjin, you can also find the unique ACROS Fukuoka building, with plants and trees covering its tiered roof.


* Canal City - This large shopping and entertainment complex is pretty to walk through, and has plentiful shops, restaurants, and theaters.  The Lion King was actually premiering the first day we went there.  This is the complex that houses Ramen stadium, where you can eat ramen from different shops to your heart's content.  Even though there are a lot of big-name shops here as well, Vince found his favorite clothing shop in Canal City, called Tornado Mart Word.

### Sightseeing

* We didn't do much sightseeing in Fukuoka, although I would have loved to spend more time there to explore more.  

- Uminonakamichi Seaside Park - We went to Uminonakamichi Seaside Park in hopes of seeing sakura in bloom, and other colorful flowers.  However, it's actually a large, family-friendly park that has flower gardens, an amusement park, a water park, and a zoo, and you can rent bikes to get around a little more easily.  There is also an aquarium nearby, the Marine World Uminonakamichi.  When we went to the park, most of the tulips were in bloom, and some of the sakura, but it would have been better to go in April for sakura mankai, and in May for the roses.  We spent some time in the zoo, too, which is small, but pretty entertaining for children.


- Nanzoin Temple - Nazoin is located in Sasaguri, which is about a 30-40 min train ride from Hakata.  It houses the largest bronze reclining Buddha in the world.  While that it impressive in and of itself, the temple and its surroundings are really peaceful and serene, away from the hubbub of city life.  The entrance to the temple actually has signs saying that large group tours are not allowed, which makes sense, since it's first and foremost a religious temple, and not a tourist attraction.  As a bonus, since the temple is nestled on a mountainside, if you venture along the pathways leading to the back, you will come across a beautiful bamboo forest.  


- Ohori Koen - This park is super cute and has a running track around it, which is why I visited.  There's a big lake in the center, and it's right next to Fukuoka Art Museum and Maizuru Park, which houses the Fukuoka Castle Ruins.  Unfortunately, it was a bit early for us to see sakura there.  


- Nishi Koen - Nishi park is one of the best spots in Fukuoka for sakura viewing, and in the top 100 spots for hanami in Japan. There are 1,300 cherry trees in this park, and the meandering walkways are very pleasant.  We were still a little early for hanami when we went in late March, but there were already a good number of trees in bloom.  This park is now extra special to me, because my now-fiance picked a cute cherry blossom grove there to propose to me.
